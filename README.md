# Tools

Some basic tools I use, mostly in PowerShell/cmd/bash.

## Author note:

I can only confirm that the cmd scripts are truly reliable. I try my best to ensure that I produce working, stable versions of my scripts in every possible CLI. Windows requires that .ps1 scripts come with certificates, and the ones offered in this repository are not self signed. If the repository is cloned, then they _should_ work normally; but I do not expect everyone to be doing that.
